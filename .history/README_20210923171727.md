*Project Name:* The String


*Project Description:*

This is a project for my fall 2021 Communications lab class. The goal wass to create a compelling website that displayed a video that we had created earlier in the class.

The main interaction on the main page of my website is meant to make the user followw the path of a string that appears near the ttop of the page. The string is animated using a Lottie Json and extends down the page from the initial home page to reveal our video. 

Many if not all of the elements on my site either change opacity or color to react to the user's hovering andd create a more interactive experience. 


*Process:* 

I began the process of creating this website by creating a wireframe that represented a more traditional "click around" website. When I started thinking about and implimenting interaction through Javascript, however, I found that I didn't feel connected to what I was doing. It was disjointed. That was wwhen I decided to add animation in order the connect things and grab the attention of my audience. 

The majority of the time I spent on this project was in designing, tweaking, and debuggin this animation. Figuring out the Javascript ended up being more challenging than I initially thought, and I ended up having to create a cascade of nested divs in order to get the interraction I wanted. 

Thankfully, in the end I was able to make it work.



*Reflection/Evaluation:*
  
In this project it was my goal to create an elegant and immersive initial website experience that draws the user in by sparking their curiosity. I believe that in the end, I managed to create a website that did this effectively and efficiently. If I were to spend more time on it, I would mostly add more content, but since my main goal was interaction design, I am satisfied with what I was able to make.
